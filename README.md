# Project 1

## Machine Learning Models' Predictions of Supermarket Data

## This repo contains the following files:
- final_model1.pkl
- final_model2.pkl
- final_model3.pkl
- supermarket_sales.csv
- testing.ipynb
- training.ipynb

## Model / Code Use
- To use these models, the custom transformers, Date_Encode() and Time_encode(), are easily found at the beginning of testing.ipynb. These are essential for the model's functions.
- To test, the dropping of predicted values must be performed BEFORE attempting to train or
